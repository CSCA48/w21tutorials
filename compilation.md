# Setup Check

At this point in time, hopefully you have followed to install MinGW onto your machine. Typing ``gcc --version`` should yield something similar to the following output:

```
C:\Users\Charles>gcc --version
gcc (MinGW.org GCC Build-2) 9.2.0
Copyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
```

If you instead get something else, something's wrong.

```
C:\Users\Charles>gcc --version
'gcc' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

Here is an example of how my Environmental Variables look like.

Notice how the entry ``C:\MinGW\bin`` is the absolute path to the directory of where my ``gcc`` installation is located at.

You will need to change this PATH to your own file location if necessary.

# Compilation

It is time to compile your first C program! No, there is no "Run" button like Python's Wing IDE.

To organize ourselves, let us create a folder just dedicated to CSCA48 programs.

If we right click the address bar and click ``Edit Address``, we will be able to see the ``Absolute Path``.

My ``Absolute Path`` is ``C:\Users\Charles\Desktop\CSCA48\w21``. This is where my folder is located on my drive.

We now need to change the ``Working Directory`` of our ``Terminal`` / ``Command Prompt`` / ``Powershell`` to the folder we've just created. This tells our ``Terminal`` where to look for files. By default, the ``Working Directory`` starts off at your ``User Profile``.

For example, my ``Working Directory`` starts off at ``C:\Users\Charles`` when ``Terminal`` is initially launched. But wait, I don't have any ``.c`` files here -- and I don't want to make any files here either! Let's change it to the ``Absolute Path`` of where my folder is located above. You may need to wrap the path in double quotations.

``>>> cd "C:\Users\Charles\Desktop\CSCA48\w21"``

After executing the ``cd (Change Directory)`` command, you should see your ``Terminal`` reflect changes immediately.

Now we need to create a new ``.c`` file. There are many ways of doing that (eg. through ``Windows Explorer``), but for compatibility's sake (as students reading this guide are on both ``MAC OS`` or ``Windows``), simply execute ``echo "" > test.c``. In other words, print an empty line to the file ``test.c``.

![alt text](https://kthisiscvpv.com/AYKd9eHZyXwS7LGrIz.png)

Now open the newly created file ``test.c`` with your favourite text editor. We can now write our ``Hello World!``.

![alt text](https://kthisiscvpv.com/6U2JQBygTNUt0effQy.png)

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hello World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

After saving the file, we will now need to compile it. 

```
>>> gcc test.c -o test
```

Compile the file ``test.c`` to the executable ``-o`` named ``test``. Note that the ``-o`` flag is not necessary. By default, you should see the output be a file named ``a``.

On ``Windows 10``, this generates a file named ``test.exe``. However, on different operating systems, you might get a different result. Now all that's left to do is run the program!
